EXECUTION PLAN — Databricks Mastery with Co‑Pilot (Qzi)
Permanent Starting Point — Use This Anytime to Resume the Project

This document defines the entire execution path, all levels, all modules, all KPIs, and the rules of engagement between Usman and Co‑Pilot (Qzi).
It ensures that no matter when the project is resumed, the direction is always clear, consistent, and aligned with the standards set by your other flagship repos.

1. PROJECT IDENTITY
Project Name: Databricks Mastery with Co‑Pilot (Qzi)  
Project Type: Full‑spectrum, architect‑grade lakehouse engineering program
Project Goal: Build a complete Databricks mastery track from foundations to enterprise‑grade architecture
Competition Standard:

Project‑ML‑Engineering‑Laboratory (Claude)

Project‑Docker‑Native‑Distributed‑Data‑Pipeline (ChatGPT)

Project‑Databricks‑Mastery‑with‑Co‑Pilot‑Qzi (This)

This project must match or exceed the structural clarity, modularity, and artifact quality of the other two.

2. PROJECT STRUCTURE (4 LEVELS)
Code
Level1 – Foundations
Level2 – Automation & Workflows
Level3 – Optimization, DLT & Unity Catalog
Level4 – Performance, Governance & Multi‑Cloud Architecture
Each level contains modules, each module contains deliverables, and each deliverable has KPIs.

3. LEVEL 1 — FOUNDATIONS (3 MODULES)
This is the level we are currently building.

Module 1.1 — Workspace & Notebooks
Deliverables:

Python notebook

SQL notebook

Markdown + code + results

KPIs:

KPI‑1: Notebook runs without cluster errors

KPI‑2: Notebook includes markdown + code + results

Module 1.2 — Spark DataFrames
Deliverables:

sample_etl_demo.py

Read → Transform → Write (Parquet + Delta)

KPIs:

KPI‑3: Mini ETL pipeline completed

KPI‑4: Explain plan interpreted

Module 1.3 — Your Own Delta Dataset
Deliverables:

01_generate_delta_dataset.py

02_transform_and_crud.py

README for module

KPIs:

KPI‑5: Custom Delta table created

KPI‑6: CRUD operations validated

KPI‑7: Time travel versions created

KPI‑8: Table registered in metastore

4. LEVEL 2 — AUTOMATION & WORKFLOWS (PREVIEW)
(Not executed yet — included for roadmap clarity)

Modules:
Workflow creation

Multi‑task pipelines

Parameterized jobs

Retry logic

KPIs:
Automated Bronze → Silver → Gold pipeline

Parameterized job runs

Workflow reliability validated

5. LEVEL 3 — OPTIMIZATION, DLT & UNITY CATALOG (PREVIEW)
Modules:
DLT pipeline

Expectations (data quality)

Z‑ORDER, OPTIMIZE, VACUUM

Unity Catalog governance

KPIs:
DLT pipeline runs clean

Expectations enforced

Query performance improved

UC permissions validated

6. LEVEL 4 — PERFORMANCE, GOVERNANCE & MULTI‑CLOUD (PREVIEW)
Modules:
Spark performance tuning

Photon optimization

PII governance

Multi‑cloud architecture

KPIs:
Skew mitigation

Memory optimization

Masking/tokenization

Multi‑cloud design documented

7. SLA RULES (PERMANENT)
All failures due to unclear instructions = my failure

All KPIs must be measurable

All artifacts must be reproducible

All modules must be zero‑drift

You never guess — I provide the path

You never debug my design — I fix it

8. HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT (THE KEY PART)
Whenever you want to resume the project, simply paste:

“Start from the Execution Plan — Level X, Module Y.”

Examples:

“Start from the Execution Plan — Level 1, Module 1.3.”

“Start from the Execution Plan — Level 2.”

“Start from the Execution Plan — continue where we left off.”

“Start from the Execution Plan — regenerate Module 1.3 notebooks.”

This eliminates all confusion, resets context, and ensures perfect continuity.

9. CURRENT STATUS (TODAY) 2/12/2026

Level 1 is active
Module 1.3 is next
Notebook 1 (01_generate_delta_dataset.py) is the next deliverable
