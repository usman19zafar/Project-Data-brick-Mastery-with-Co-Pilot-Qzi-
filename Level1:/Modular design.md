# LEVEL 1 — COMPLETE SCOPE (3 MODULES)

## Module 1.1 — Workspace + Notebooks  
## Module 1.2 — Spark DataFrames  
## Module 1.3 — Your Own Delta Dataset (the two‑notebook pipeline)

The two notebooks I’m about to deliver belong to Module 1.3, but Level 1 is only considered PASSED when all three modules are completed and their KPIs are met.

You’ve confirmed the structure.
I’ve confirmed the SLA.
We’re aligned.

LEVEL 1 = 3 MODULES (TOTAL SCOPE)
You must complete all three to pass Level 1 KPIs.

# MODULE 1.1 — Workspace + Notebooks
Artifacts: none (just setup)

KPIs:

Notebook runs clean

Markdown + code + results in one file

# MODULE 1.2 — Spark DataFrames
Artifacts:

Reads from sample datasets

Basic transforms

Writes Parquet + Delta

## KPIs:

Mini ETL (raw → cleaned → aggregated)

df.explain() interpreted

# MODULE 1.3 — Your Own Delta Dataset
Artifacts:

Notebook 1 (data generation + Delta write)

Notebook 2 (transform + CRUD + explain plan)

## KPIs:

One fully owned Delta table

CRUD works

Versioning ready for time travel
